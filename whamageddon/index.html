  <h2>Whamageddon</h2>
  <p><i>Not to be confused with the similarly named but incorrect H project which can be found <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/944868027>here</a>. The project has a couple minor counting errors and also forgor to include me, despite me posting to Geometry Dash each time I got whammed.</i>
  <p>
    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whamageddon>Whamageddon</a> is a challenge that us H-Makers have been doing since 2021. The goal is to reach Christmas without hearing the song "Last Christmas" by Wham, starting from the beginning of December. If you do get whammed (which is to hear the song), then you lose and are sent to the first level of Whamhalla. Successive whams send you to the next level. Remixes and covers do NOT count against you.
  </p>
  <p>Whams normally occur on the radio, advertisements, or in public places by the staff of said place. Being whammed in any other, unconventional means, like being played in school because someone requested it to (That's real, it has happened to BombCraft), is called a whambush. Whamming yourself is to commit Whamicide, which may or may not be a serious Whamageddon crime. LD123Rises is not participating in Whamageddon, thus he is not to be added to Whamhalla, as Hexagon once again erroneously stated.</p>
  <p>2022's results can be found <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/781187363/>here</a>.</p>
  <p>If you get whammed, you have to post #Whamageddon on all platforms to signify that you lost the challenge.</p>
