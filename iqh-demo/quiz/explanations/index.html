  <h2>Explanations And Credits</h2>
  
  <p>Well done, you! You beat the quiz! Hopefully you didn't CHEAT in some way... You are probably wondering, "Why is the answer to "DISPLAY" "UH UH"?" Or... 
 "Why does a 2-second bomb question exist?" Hopefully, I can answer these questions, just as you did with mine. Also, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/861430297">here are fourteen more questions that will be in the full game!</a> Ask BCMGF1137/19 or BombCraft for the answers, as BombCraft made the questions and messaged the answers to BCMGF1137/19 on chess.com (but nobody cares about that information)</p>

      <th>7</th>
      <th>There is no rule against fantasy books in either H or Replit, and this question is a reference to one of the most famous fantasy books, the Bible. (Some might disagree with me, but Noah could not have fit every single species of animal that was around a few thousand years onto the Ark with the dimensions specified in the Bible.) Anyway, you might think the answer should have been 1. However, in the Bible, Noah was actually asked by God to bring <b>7</b> of each gender of each clean animal onto the Ark. It was the unclean animals that only 1 of each gender of each clean animal was brought. What's the difference between clean and unclean? Clean animals were allowed to be eaten (e.g. lamb, goat), while unclean animals were not allowed to be eaten. (Genesis 6:14â€“16)</th>

The top of the guitar has 8 holes with the tuners (the pegs create new holes), and one more with the hole on the big part. 8+1=9, so the answer is 9. It <em>is</em> actually the question number in this quiz, but not in the full version, which is why you can't click on the question number.</th>

      <th>DISPLAY</th>
      <th>UH UH</th>
      <th>This is a reference to Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, where you have to defuse the bomb. This comes from "Who's On First", and is hard to explain it all. Go to <a href = "https://www.bombmanual.com/web/index.html">this link</a> to see the full manual!<br>
      The general explanation for this case is this: The display is "DISPLAY". For this, we look on the bottom-right answer (middle left/right doesn't exist here... yet), and it is "WHAT?". Keep in mind there are TWO "WHAT"s: one <b>with</b> a question mark and one <b>without</b> a question mark. Then, it asks you to press the label that comes first in this list: YOU, HOLD, YOU'RE, YOUR, U, DONE, <u>UH UH</u>, LIKE, YOU ARE, UH HUH, UR, NEXT, WHAT?, SURE. "UH UH" comes first, therefore, that's the answer. One more thing: playstation sucks.

There was one instance where he was absent, and I asked my friends about it before the starting bell rang. Turns out, he had to leave chemistry class.

You should've paid more attention in your Language Arts classes... <br><b>OH CRAP.<!-- WHO MADE IT SAY CREP? >:( --></b><br> Anyway, allow me to trouble you with some 3rd Grade literature. This comes from Roald Dahl's book, "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory". However, this specific scene was not shown in the movies! In this scene, Mike Teavee, shrunk via television, is offerred a triple overdose of Wonka's Supervitamin Chocolate: "Supervitamin Chocolate contains huge amounts of vitamin A and vitamin B. It also contains vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin F, vitamin G, vitamin I, vitamin J, vitamin K, vitamin L, vitamin M, vitamin N, vitamin O, vitamin P, vitamin Q, vitamin R, vitamin T, vitamin U, vitamin V, vitamin W, vitamin X, vitamin Y, <em>and,</em> believe it or not, vitamin Z! The only two vitamins it doesn't have in it are <b>vitamin S, because it makes you sick, </b>and vitamin H, because it makes you grow horns on the top of your head, like a bull" (Dahl 158-159). Notice that Supervitamin Chocolate doesn't include vitamin S, so that's the correct answer.</th>

(his real name is Arlo, but he doesn't like being called that), calls the PTA "<u>P</u>arents who <u>T</u>alk <u>A</u> lot".
