  <h2>Non-canon Heriodic Table Elements</h2>

  <p>Non-canon Heriodic Table elements are elements that have been added to the Heriodic Table, but are non-canon and thus should be removed. A common reason for an element being non-canon is due to Hexagon having failed chemistry class each year without fail since 2019.</p>

      <th>Hexagon already has an element, that being Hexium (Hx), which is the 13th element. Due to his annoyingness and immaturity, he does not deserve any more. The fact that BCMGF1137 said that Hexagon, who is undoubtedly the most immature H-maker to ever exist, deserves FOUR elements shows how delusional BCMGF1137 is, and thus, he does not have the right to call <b>ME</b> delusional. I suspect that BCMGF1137's obviously bullshit claim that Hexagon deserves four elements in the heriodic table might be a sign of BCMGF1137 being a simp, which is just gross. Please remember that Hexagon is not the second coming of Jesus, thus you must not treat him like a king based on how utterly annoying and immature he is. (But then again, Hexagon is in Gen Alpha, and I have never seen anyone in Gen Alpha with any maturity whatsoever).</th>
