      Welcome back! I know, it's been 2 months since the last edition of this. I forgot about this. But now that a place exists for The H Times archives and school's wrapped up, I can get back to making these every Sunday. (actually I won't lol)<br />
    Shall we begin again!

    <h4>Operation: Hectonerf / Part 12 (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/864046280/">H3,741</a>, GD 91477378)</h4>
  
    <p>
      Instead of H: Travel Part 12, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/30ISTSChannel/">Cube</a> (GD IzzyConfusing) gives us Operation: Hectonerf, making various nerfs throughout the level. The changes are, in order:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Part 4: The fake wall is removed (20%)</li>
        <li>Part 5: The mirror portal is readded (26%)</li>
        <li>
          Part 6: 
          <ul>
            <li>A platform to rest on is added (30%)</li>
            <li>A mirror portal is added to mirror the one in Part 5 (37%)</li>
            <li>The timings are completely removed for being very finicky (40%)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Part 7 / 8: The whole knobbelboy wave is nerfed for being a triple speed cancer wave dual (59 - 63%, <i>"It's a triple speed mini cancer wave dual, and I'm not good at such duals" - IzzyConfusing, 62%</i>)</li> <!-- The original comment said "tripple", but I decided to fix the typo because we here at Oshawott Skinning Inc. detest typos -->
        <li>
          Part 9:
          <ul>
            <li>The robot is now completely mini (64 - 65%)</li>
            <li>The UFO spam is made easier (70 - 71%)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Part 10:
          <ul>
            <li>The Hexagon is moved back a few units so you can actually see the spider portal (74%)</li>
            <li>The timings are changed a bit (75 - 78%)</li>
            <li>The level is moved down because the dual portals are broken (81% - )</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Part 11: The penultimate pillar is moved up (98%)</li>
        <li>Part 13: Is now a single speed <del>cube</del> square instead of a quadruple speed ship, and the entire rest of the level is removed (100%)</li>
      </ul>
    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ALESJlF/">ALESJlF</a> (GD CreamySurimi) was given Part 13.
  
    <h4><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> is indefinitely banned from H (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/864110064">H3,745</a>)</h4>
  
    <p>
      On <a href="https://discord.gg/2fHVnBRDBu">H: The Server</a>, it was announced at 8:27 PM EDT that, and I quote:
      <blockquote>
        "So <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> called me a “bigot” over me secretly banning him from H. I’d like to say that I’m NOT banning him over him being an atheist. I am, however, banning him for repeatedly insulting Christians and Muslims, which is <b>NOT HEALTHY FOR H: THE SERIES.</b><br /><br />
        The thing is this: Being religious/non-religious are both okay in the studio. Repeatedly disrespecting a group, on the other hand, is not!<br /><br />
        This is why I’m COMPLETELY cutting ties with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a>, avoiding communication at all costs. I won’t talk to him anymore for his actions, and I can’t believe I <u>actually</u> felt like a friend of his…<br /><br /> 
        This will be my last entry on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a>. In the meantime, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> is banned from H: The Series <b>INDEFINITELY.</b><br /><br />
        Thank you."
      </blockquote>

    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> was now indefinitely banned from H, with no indication of when this ban would be lifted. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> refused this whole thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/30ISTSChannel/">Hexagon</a> then proceeded to <b>BAN</b> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> from H: Travel for <b>5 parts.</b> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> said that his next part was Part 16, when it was actually now Part 18.

    <h4><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> gets banned from Scratch</h4>

    <p>
      For a comment that was being sarcastic that could easily be taken out-of-context as self-injury.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> apologizes (GD 91523414)</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> apologizes to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/dimayajonelcid">BCMGF1137/19</a> about what he did. However, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/dimayajonelcid">BCMGF1137/19</a> never saw it, because he had cut ties with him the previous day, proving that he will regret cutting ties...

    <h4>H-Baker role exists???? (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/864560959">H3,762</a>)</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/dimayajonelcid">BCMGF1137/19</a> was questioned as to why does this role even EXISTS on <a href="https://discord.gg/2fHVnBRDBu">H: The Server</a>.

    <h4>The H Iceberg (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/864910672">v5.6</a>)</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/30ISTSChannel/">Cube</a> makes v5.6 of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/31901499">The H Iceberg</a>, called the <i>I dont know Update</i> because he made many changes that have little to eachother. These changes are:
      <ul>
        <li>Changed every instance of Hexagon / 30IS to Cube. This is because <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/30ISTSChannel/">Cube</a> was rebranding on Scratch to Cube at the time.</li>
        <li>Updated Leafonetix. This entry was really outdated, as last time it was updated was before it became a dumpster fire.</li>
        <li>Updated BombCraft. The entry didn't go into detail about BombCraft vs. Cube.</li>
        <li>Added Cube is NOT a [REDACTED]. Goes into further detail about BombCraft vs. Cube,</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> make a project with his apology</h4>

    <p>
      It's not an H. It's <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/864971365/">here</a>. But nobody cares about it because it's on an alt.

    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> tells people to stop hating him (GD 91548678)</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> really does not want people hating him. He even links his apology project.

    <h3>June 14th, 2023</h3>

    <p>Sadly, we had no news about H today ):</p>

    <h4><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a>'s H Manager speedrun (GD 91600907)</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/BombCraft/">BombCraft</a> makes a level about getting manager as quickly as possible. He also insults <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/30ISTSChannel/">Cube</a>, saying that he added lies to the iceberg to make him sound like he's worse than 1-WHOOPS! We do NOT talk about THAT person!
    </p>

    <h3>June 16th, 2023</h3>

    <h4>H Milestone irony (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/866201600">H3,776</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/866217925">H3,777</a>)</h4>

    <p>
      In an ironic turn of events, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/30ISTSChannel/">Cube</a> got <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/866217925">H3,777</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/lionheart921">ThebigH</a> gets <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/866201600">H3,776</a>, or 2,5252 seximal.
