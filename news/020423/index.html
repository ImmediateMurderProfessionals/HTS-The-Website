  <h3>"Never Gonna Give You Up, Never Gonna Let You Down"</h3>

  <div id="toc" toplvhead="3"></div>

  <div id="content">
    <p>This is the very first weekly The H Times <del>project</del> edition, so I hope you like it!</p>

    <del>
      <p>I'd like to discuss some new improvements to the Typing Text Engine that I've done.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Colors - As you may of just witnessed, the colors can now <span style="color: red">change on command.</span></li>
        <li>
          Smart Scrolling - You no longer need to stop your sentence midway to broadcast to "Shift Everything". Sadly, this requires more than 300 clones at size 300 :(<br/>
          The "Shift Everything" broadcast will now stop if the cursor goes above y position 140, which is where text starts to fade.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </del>

    <p>Anyways, time for the actual news.</p>
