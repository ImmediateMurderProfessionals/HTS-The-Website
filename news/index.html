  <h2>The H Times</h2>

  <p>
    The H Times is a weekly H newspaper that started by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/30ISTSChannel/">Cube</a> with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/829794022/">H3,373</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It had a wacky start, as only a single edition was ever released on Scratch, being the original April 2nd, 2023 edition. It also doesn't get editions that often; this should be fixed soon. There is also an edition for October 8, 2023, however I still need to edit it to remove all content critical of me before I can add it to this site.

    Latest edition: <a href="180623/">June 18th, 2023</a>
