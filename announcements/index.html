    <h3>marijuana</h3>

    <p class="date">Posted Jan 31, 2024 by BombCraft</p>

    <p>The main reason I was mad about Hexagon adding an IP grabber to his website is because I do not trust him with people's IPs; he posted my IP to chess.com three and a half weeks ago and got banned, I shudder when thinking of what he could do with the IPs of everyone who visits the site...</p>

    <h3>i swing my banhammer</h3>

    <p class="date">Posted Jan 9, 2024 by BombCraft</p>

    <p>Yesterday, Hexagon posted my IP address to his chess.com blog, which I do not allow. He claims I doxxed myself, but I didn't because he only knows my IP due to two sites, one of which is closed and the other is never used. Today, chess.com mods banned him because you can't doxx him. IMO he only should've been muted, and I would also only demote him to curator instead of banning him because I have empathy and know how much he loves H. I think I also should be unbanned, as Blue's doxxing was an honest mistake (compared to my doxxing which clearly wasn't), but that's a different story.</p>

    <h3>Replit fucking killed repl.co</h3>

    <p class="date">Posted Jan 8, 2024 by Hexagon</p>

    <p>Replit decided to straight up kill repl.co domains, which is a fucking bad idea. They warned me! Yet I forgot. So I was forced to move this and IUG and that unnamed platformer over to GitHub so they could still exist! I might just delete my Replit account soon!</p>

    <h3>HOLY MOTHER OF SATAN, 2.2 IS OUT!!!!!!!!</h3>

    <p>Last night, at around 8:30 PM EST, RobTop released update 2.2 in Geometry Dash! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!! Too bad I have to wait until 3:00 to play it, but that's only six hours away. Just have to make it through seven more hellish school periods...</p>

    <h3>Someone made false claims that I am a zoophile. WTF</h3>

    <p class="date">Posted Dec 12, 2023 by BombCraft</p>

    <p>So, back in August, a notable troll known as "Xumi Chess" on chess.com who had been trolling me since July and had told me to kill myself five times accused me of terrible things. He pretended to be a girl (No, I am not transphobic. He identifies as a man) and actually knows he is bad, based on his claims that I am Xumi Chess. He has impersonated me on <a href=https://www.chess.com/member/bombcraft2>chess.com</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@HTheSeries>YouTube</a> (I don't have a YouTube channel as of 12/12/2023) to spread false rumors that I send people bestiality and, and I quote, "fuck my dog" (I don't have a dog). He, an avid racist based on when he called an Indian chess player a "call center scammer" and called a 12-year-old Indian girl who lives in the US a "perfect ad for contraception", also photoshopped one of my comments to make it look like I own child porn. I AM 13 YEARS OLD, FOR SATAN'S SAKE!!! This was back in August, and it culminated on August 27, 2023, when he uploaded this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIDIbcl_vGs">fake exposal video</a>, which took about fifteen seconds for me to <a href=https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/view/every-mistake-in-this-fake-exposal-video-by-xumi-tw-only-for-people-16-we-need-a-spoiler-tag>prove false</a>. Xumi then underwent a period of not trolling as much on chess.com, but has recently started to come back to trolling, as he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGPbr__VJRw">reuploaded the fake exposal video</a> and made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMrVvtHKFis">part 2</a>, where he reported me, an innocent 13-year old. He used an account called "<a href=https://www.chess.com/member/please_stop_trolling>Please_Stop_Trolling</a>" and recently made a new account with the disgusting name "<a href=https://www.chess.com/member/cheesyclit_the_wgm>CheeSyclit_The_WGM</a>", where he made more completely bullsh*t accusations of me being a zoophile.</p>
