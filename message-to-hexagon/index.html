It is very offensive to me (I think, judging by the title the content probably isn't that great), seeing as I barely did anything wrong. Not only did you misspell "annihilator", you need to STOP BRINGING UP DRAMA THAT HAPPENED 7-8 MONTHS AGO, IT SHOULD BE OVER NOW. You're just making me more and more mad by making offensive shit like this; I DO NOT DESERVE HATE; I HAVE HAD FAR MORE THAN ENOUGH BETWEEN YOU AND XUMI CHESS (Xumi Chess made false claims that I am a racist zoophile who owns child porn)

What I did was not even that bad! For the 6231647096217354623846518275480234569732564962349752397546802665783460572th time, I was NOT THINKING WHEN I DOXXED BLUE, and was actually in fact trying to COMPLIMENT HIM! I am also extremely sorry for what I did. There are a few reasons why I called you a male karen, mostly due to your immaturity. That drama is over, and while I do still hold my case that you are super annoying and immature, I will stop calling you names, as I am a 13 year old with the maturity of a 15 year old, and mature people like me do not call people names unless they really, REALLY deserve it (you don't, but Xumi Chess does). You and BCMGF need to learn that the drama was in the past and I have changed; I really want to get back into HTS. Just because I did bad things over half a year ago doesn't mean I am still bad now. I am much better (but please, don't look at my Geometry Dash levels. They are for ages 13+, and my sense of humor (based on what I upload) should not affect my status within HTS. If you don't like my GD levels, just don't look at them. Simple as that.) I have long since stopped being offensive to religious groups, and I am more tolerant of religions now; I just hate when religious people do bad things due to their religion (e.g. homophobia). You two need to grow up and learn to accept apologies. I find it crazy how BCMGF is going to be 17 in a month and still vehemently refuses to forgive me, instead making dumb jabs at me (e.g. calling me delusional) and thinking I, a person who has obviously changed for the better since the summer, haven't changed since the summer. If you two had forgiven me back in June/July, we wouldn't be here. But we are. It is never too late to forgive me; I am an extremely forgiving person (unless the culprit does something unforgivable, but 99.999% of people don't do unforgivable things to be honest)

Also, you do NOT deserve four elements in the heriodic table.

Also also, you do NOT deserve to get treated like a king (BCMGF1137 needs to stop treating you like a king, no idea why he still does so when he should know how annoying and immature you are)
