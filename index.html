  Also, just because axothan got featured and he used your site, doesn't mean your site is the best thing in the world and my site sucks ass. Your version literally has counting errors in the Whamageddon standings (that are fixed here), and besides, I am likely going to get featured in Geometry Dash within the next few months, so quit yapping. Hexagon, you are not the Messiah, you and Blue both need to know that. Both of our sites are equally real. In fact, the link to your site on my site doesn't list it as "fake", but instead as the "other version of this site".

<h4>TASK FOR BCMGF1137: Remove anything critical of Hexagon! (there shouldn't be much)</h4>
  
  <p><i>Warning - this place IS under construction! Empty and incomplete pages are expected. There may be typos, and if there are, comment where they are and I will fix them.</i></p>
This is not fake. I also have a volatile nature (according to Blue and I actually agree with him) so if I post anything offensive, talk to me a few hours after I post it and I will be more forgiving. (unless it is about the prophet Muhammad. You cannot forgive anyone who banged a 9 year old while he was like 53)

  <p>
  <blockquote>"H: The Series is a series of projects that people (including you, possibly) make for fun!"</blockquote>
  <br />
  - Literally the studio description

    Oh, and did you know that <b><a href="https://discord.gg/2fHVnBRDBu">H: The Server</a></b> exists? Anyone can join, but please proceed with caution! Discord is toxic, so my parents won't let me have an account because they are boomers (they are actually gen x but idc)...
    <br><br><br>
    Also, what could <b><a href="iqh-demo">this</a></b> be??
    <br>
    If you have any questions, ask <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/dimayajonelcid">BCMGF1137/19</a>, but not me, as I am banned from H as of October 2023.
