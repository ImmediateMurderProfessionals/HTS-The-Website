  <h1>HTS: The Website</h1>
  <a href="/HTS-The-Website/">Go back</a>
  <h2>H is not an anarchy studio. There are, of course, rules.</s></h2>
<br>
- H is NOT about low-effort and/or spammy projects. For more information, look at this project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/625033920<br>
- Do NOT start drama. This can happen via spamming, posting an inappropriate H, or something that can be controversial. There might be some things I missed but know Murphy's Law: If it feels like it can start drama, it will start drama. Better safe than sorry! NOTE: You will not be held responsible if the drama was unintended.<br>
- Don't carry drama into the studio. Seriously, we can be aware of outside drama, and we can't and won't let it inside H: The Series.<br>
- Remix chains should not be added to prevent spam.<br>
- Follow the Community Guidelines, obviously.<br>
- No stealing projects! We had a plague in 2022 where dozens of projects were stolen by a user and inserted into this studio!<br>
- Advertising is actually okay here! Just don't be annoying with it. And if you would like others to see your H projects, feel free to do so in the comments, provided they arent SOFTCAPPed.<br>
- Do not doxx other users (reveal their personal info without their consent). I doxxed Blue by revealing his hometown in the comments of the Geometry Dash level "CraZy II" by DavJT back in May 2023, and I am proud to say that I learned my lesson.<br>
- Do not wish for the death of other H makers.<br>
- Do not falsely accuse anyone of anything. A troll on chess.com falsely claimed I own child porn and photoshopped a comment of mine as "proof" back in August 2023. The fake video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIDIbcl_vGs">here</a><br>.
- Do not let 10274837 or G into the studio. 10274837 is still technically an H-maker as he has posted at least 1 H before, so you may not wish for his death.<br>
- No bigotry. I am an autistic atheist so I have experienced bigotry (almost exclusively online, as the people at school have morals for the most part). In fact, I used to use "gay" as an insult when I was younger, however that was likely due to my own stupidity and not homophobia. TS2021, who is a month younger than me (my birthday is 3/29/2010, his is 4/28/2010), made a Geometry Dash comment on 9/15/2023 calling me "so f***ing gay" to insult me (I'm straight but that may change). The worst part about it is that Blue, the owner of H, AGREED WITH HIM. Did I write too much here?<br>
- No supporting Donald Trump. He is part of G.<br>
- Ron Desantis is higher in G, but you are allowed to support him because he actually has sanity (Trump's insanity is why he isn't as high as Desantis is) and is good at handling hurricanes (however that is pretty much required if you want to be the governor of Florida ngl)<br>
- Do not mock the mental health of others. My mental health sucks. Just look at my recent Geometry Dash levels (my username is BombCraftHTS).<br>
- Do not organize hate towards others. Here is an example of what not to do.<br>
<IMG SRC = "bruh.png" height="142" width="700"><br>
- Do not impersonate others.<br>
- Do not let Hexagon make anything about the Heriodic Table; he knows nothing about the real periodic table, as evidenced by him spamming stable odd-odd nuclei in the isotopic table, which should not happen because there are only five stable odd-odd nuclei IRL: <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>6</sup>Li, <sup>10</sup>B, <sup>14</sup>N, and <sup>180m</sup>Ta, but <sup>180m</sup>Ta is theorized to be radioactive with a long half-life.<br>
- Hexium-30 is not stable because of that same rule about odd-odd nuclei. <br>
- My heriodic table is better than Hexagon's (LOL) <br>
- You are not allowed to subscribe to Cocomelon. Cocomelon is a <s>MAGA nazi who kidnaps children and sexually abuses them</s> kids channel on YouTube that is also part of G.<br>
- Keep things PG. The youngest H maker is 9 (I think).<br>
- Do not call BombCraft stupid; he is the smartest person in his middle school.<br>
- Do not call others stupid unless they really are; I do not know the intellect of other H makers.<br>
- Anyone who sells H-themed stickers will be banned, <s>doxxed, tortured, murdered, nuked, burglarized, and turned into an UNmarketable plushie.</s><br>

- Anyone caught being a G spy will receive these punishments:<br>
Get permanently blocked<br>
