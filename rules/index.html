  <h1>HTS: The Website</h1>
  <a href="/HTS-The-Website/">Go back</a>
  <h2>H is not an anarchy studio. There are, of course, rules.</s></h2>
<br>
- H is NOT about low-effort and/or spammy projects. For more information, look at this project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/625033920<br>
- Do NOT start drama. This can happen via spamming, posting an inappropriate H, or something that can be controversial. There might be some things I missed but know Murphy's Law: If it feels like it can start drama, it will start drama. Better safe than sorry! NOTE: You will not be held responsible if the drama was unintended.<br>
- Don't carry drama into the studio. Seriously, we can be aware of outside drama, and we can't and won't let it inside H: The Series.<br>
- Remix chains should not be added to prevent spam.<br>
- Follow the Community Guidelines, obviously.<br>
- No stealing projects! We had a plague in 2022 where dozens of projects were stolen by a user and inserted into this studio!<br>
- Advertising is actually okay here! Just don't be annoying with it. And if you would like others to see your H projects, feel free to do so in the comments, provided they arent SOFTCAPPed.<br>
- Do not doxx other users (reveal their personal info without their consent). Back in May 2023, I doxxed Blue by revealing his hometown in the comments of the Geometry Dash level "CraZy II" by DavJT back in May 2023, and I am proud to say that I learned my lesson.<br>
- Do not wish for the death of other H makers.<br>
- Do not falsely accuse anyone of anything.<br>
- Do not let 10274837 or G into the studio. 10274837 is still technically an H-maker as he has posted at least 1 H before, so you may not wish for his death.<br>
- No bigotry.<br>
- Do not organize hate towards others.<br>
- Do not impersonate others.<br>
- You are not allowed to subscribe to Cocomelon. Cocomelon is a <s>MAGA nazi who kidnaps children and sexually abuses them</s> kids channel on YouTube that is also part of G.<br>
- Keep things PG. The youngest H maker is 9 (I think).<br>
- Anyone who sells H-themed stickers will be banned, <s>doxxed, tortured, murdered, nuked, burglarized, and turned into an UNmarketable plushie.</s><br>

- Anyone caught being a G spy will receive these punishments:<br>
Get permanently blocked<br>
