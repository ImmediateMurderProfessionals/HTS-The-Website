Bombium is the 23rd element of the heriodic table. It is named after [[BombCraft]], a former and future (but not present) H maker who is also the creator of this page. It has four notable isotopes, B-53, B-54, B-55, and B-56. B-53 and B-55 are both stable and are pretty much the same except B-55 has two more neutrons and B-53 is found in the earth's core while B-55 is found on the earth's surface; this is why Bombium's atomic weight is 54.813. B-54 is found in the earth's mantle and has a half-life of 915,844,245 years, with an 82% chance to beta-minus decay into the stable Gf-54 and an 18% chance to undergo electron capture, turning into the also stable Ex-54. B-56 is synthetic and is commonly used in nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs, often in conjunction with Hexium because of the explosive reaction that Bombium and Hexium undergo when near each other. B-56 has a half-life of 146 days before beta-minus decaying into Gf-56. (B-51 and B-52 both have longer half-lives than B-56 but aren't used much because B-56 is easier to produce)

Bombium is a very chaotic element, often changing color, which can cause seizures and occasionally (curable, thank satan) blindness. Pure bombium takes the form of a colorful powder (it also rarely takes the form of a beautiful gemstone, similar to Hexium; this represents the fact that both Hexagon and I are annoying), and is non toxic and doesn't react with any of the human body's chemicals; it mostly only reacts with other H elements. It is flammable, although it doesn't burn until reaching 420ºF, a similar flash point to most oils. Naturally occurring Bombium is mostly found in compounds with other H elements.

=== Reactions ===

* Bombium reacts with Etagen to produce bombium dietagide, a blue compound commonly used in flags. (even though I'm not part of team HTS '''for now''')
* Blueium has two allotropes; one doesn't react with Bombium and the other reacts to produce a beautiful blue light show
* Bombium doesn't react with Defbium, Clickrium, Smorium, Yorium, Jonathanium, Aweson, Greatine, Dalon, or Drumidium
* Bombium reacts with Lionium to produce a chemical often used in games like Minesweeper and 2048.
* Bombium reacts with [[Hexium]] to produce a chemical that immediately explodes
* Bombium doesn't react with Iciclium. Zackium, Numblium, Strachium, or Califium.
* Bombium reacts with Chesium similar to how Blueium does; exactly how though I don't know yet, will add when I think of an idea.
* Bombium reacts with Minium to make it explode faster
* Bombium reacts with Gimium to produce another chemical that immediately explodes; this is because I HATE G!
* Bombium reacts with Expirium to make it even more toxic
* Bombium doesn't react with Griffium
* Bombium reacts with Cyanium to make a beautiful cyan light show
* Bombium reacts with Greenium similarly to Cyanium but green
* Bombium doesn't react with Whamium, but is magnetically attracted to it, but not as strongly as Strachium is.
* Bombium reacts with Xamplium to make a compound similar to pure Memeium
* Bombium reacts with Geomdium to produce an '''EXTREMELY''' beautiful alloy (yes, Geomdium is a metal), although that alloy can still cause seizures and curable blindness.
* Bombium reacts with Alesjium similarly to Xamplium
* Bombium doesn't react with Ledium, Owotium, Epicgium, Pixium, or Amogium (I swapped Amogium and Fardium because their symbols spelled out a slur in the heriodic table, but I still changed Amogium to Am anyway because swapping them made them now spell out a slur in the isotopic table)
* Bombium reacts with Fardium to make it less smelly; this is because I can't smell IRL
* Bombium doesn't react with Slavium or Imquizine.
* Bombium reacts with Bulgarium to produce a useless compound, but the compound is much more useful when Xamplium and Goetium are added.
* Bombium doesn't react with Ventium, Greekium, Qyoooium, Kafium, or Pentagonum (I swapped Pentagonum and Tescratium because Tescratium is supposed to be slightly radioactive with a half-life of billions of years, and odd elements are less stable than even ones and Tescratium was originally an even element but it's odd now. I might add that Tescratium may be given a stable isotope if TS2021 wishes.)
* Bombium reacts with Tescratium in conjunction with Hexium to make a chemical often used in code (like computer code not Scratch code); this is one of the only compounds with Bombium and Hexium in it that doesn't immediately go kaboom.

* Bombium reacts with Magentine similarly to Cyanium but magenta
* Bombium reacts with Memeium to make TBD
* Bombium reacts with Corkium to make TBD
* Bombium used to react with Scratchium but not anymore
* Bombium doesn't react with [[Weirdscartum]] or Nuine (I replaced Karum because the drama was too insignificant, however I changed my mind and re-added Karum but changed it to element 107 rather than 52, and I slightly changed the name to Karium (note the extra “i”))
* Bombium reacts with Lolium to make a useless chemical
* Bombium reacts with Redium similarly to Cyanium but red
* Bombium doesn't react with Undecium
* Bombium reacts with Birdium to make TBD
* Bombium reacts with Ohioium to become more chaotic before quickly exploding
* Bombium doesn't react with Kitanium because '''Splatoon 3 is better than KTANE'''
* Bombium also doesn't react with Tauium, Octillosium, Quadrinonasecoctillium, Braidenium, or Cecilium. (Unsium is discovered; it is the radioactive Cecilium. Yes, really.)
* Bombium does react with Goetium to make TBD, which is an extremely awesome compound.
* Bombium does not react with Fanium
* Bombium reacts with Waveium (I replaced Deludirium because I’m not delusional) to make a black compound often used in Geometry Dash levels and their Scratch recreations.
* Bombium does not react with Miltricubium (a radioactive element named after 1027 that replaces Noncanium) or Octadecayottonium.
* Bombium’s reaction with element 69 is to be determined, as Blue still has to come up with 69.
* Bombium does not react with Rutherium, Sisyphium, or Scratchcatnium.

* Bombium reacts with Milestonium (100) to make a compound that is often used to make numbers slightly higher or lower than milestones (this is because his only exact URL milestone is 995995995 on the Lobotomoxxie account, which was deleted by the Scratch Team because they can’t moderate, which is why I made Moderatium have a short half-life)
* Bombium does not react with Exodium (101) because he did not cause the exodus back in H4000; it also doesn’t react with Spamium (102), Lium (103), Delirium (104), Hexapentabium (105), Underagium (106), Karium (107), Fakium (108), Dymcidium (109), Markupium (110), or Offensivium (111).
* Bombium also doesn’t react with Noncanium (112; it’s different from the original Noncanium because the original was a targeted attack towards me that only represented my suggestions (whether they are canon or not has not been decided, so don’t just jump to the conclusion that they aren’t canon), but the new version represents all non-canon things) 
* Bombium does not react with Religium (113) either because he is an atheist.
* Bombium reacts with Apologium to make a compound often used in sending factually correct information to places overrun with false claims. BombCraft is currently working on making a device using Bombium apologide that will let all of H know that he is sorry for all the bad stuff he did in H and wishes to be forgiven for it; he won’t do that stuff again.
* Bombium does not react with Tritrisixium (115) or Quadtrisixium (116).

* Bombium reacts with Tablium (122) to make a chemical often found in radioactive acorns, a bright orange glowing variant of acorns native to Ohio.
* Bombium reacts with Dementium (123) to make a radioactive chemical that is notable because everyone who has seen the compound forgets everything about it; this is the case for all compounds of Dementium because Dementium’s radioactivity causes dementia, hence its name.
NOTE: Tablium and all elements past Dementium are named after things unrelated to H, such as famous scientists and where the elements were first synthesized; this is similar to all elements past plutonium in the real periodic table.
* Martium (124) is a radioactive red metal; Jupitium (125) is a radioactive blue metal; Saturnium (126) is a radioactive purple metal with a long enough half-life that it can be considered stable for all intents and purposes. Bombium reacts with all three of those elements to make them more chaotic.
* Bombium does not react with Bosium (127).
* Bombium’s reactions with Newtonium (128), Diracium (129), Daltonium (130), Pennsylvanium (131), Voidium (132), Meyerium (133), Bunsenium (134), Congregatium (135), Ritium (136), Inkopolium (137), and Estelnolium (138) are unknown due to their radioactivity.


(NOTE: This element is named after BombCraft, thus HE gets to make a description for it. He originally started making a description in late May 2024, however [[30IS]] vandalized the page and replaced it with false claims, claiming that Bombium is actually a radioactive element with a half-life of 400,000 years and that it makes a new element when reacting with Hexium instead of exploding, citing a nonexistent “Dodecahedron’s Fostulate” as proof. BombCraft tried to let Hexagon know that he does not get to make a description for Bombium because it’s his element, not Hexagon’s, but he didn’t listen and banned ALL anonymous contributions to the wiki, including BombCraft’s. As a result, this article is being edited by [[User:TS2021|TS2021]], who edits the page based on what BombCraft sends him on Github. Do NOT ban TS2021 from the H wiki, as this violates the rule that BombCraft is to make a description for HIS element.)
